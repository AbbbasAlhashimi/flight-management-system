The Project is a Flight Booking System. It consists of the following:<br>
1- <b>Index page</b> consisting of a Bootstrap form with 6 Columns, a Booking button, adding and removing current reservations.<br>
2- <b>PHP service</b> to perform a simple call select statement and return data if existed.<br>
3- <b>SQL database</b> where records are saved.<br><br>

When the agent press on <i>Make A New Reservation</i> Button, a popup form appears to let the agent fill the flight information.<br>
The user can submit the request by pressing on the <i>Create</i> Button or Cancel by pressing on the <i>Close</i> Button.
Alternatively, the agent could press anywhere outside the form; and the form will be closed automatically. <br>
The Front-end of the project was built using JQuery. When a new reservation is made, an AJAX request passed with request parameters.<br>
<ul>Each Request passes
  <ol>URL</ol>
  <ol>Method Type</ol>
  <ol>Identifiers</ol>
  <ol>DataType</ol>
  <ol>Transaction Status</ol>
</ul
